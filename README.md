# ME691-NeuralODE_net_for_Ammonia_combustion
This project was conducted as part of my undergraduate research under Prof. Dilip Sundaram(in Sem 6) and ME691-XVII course taught by Prof. Shubhangi Bhansude(in Sem 7). In this project, i developed a ML surrogate model for 0D Ammonia combustion simulations using NODE ML framework.
